### React Setup

This is my personal React Setup. I had some difficulty initially getting things
going due to documentation across multiple resources being out of date, or hard
to understand. But after powering through it, I was finally able to get
something together that I liked and that worked. 

### Setup

1. Simply clone this repo.
2. `cd` to this folder
3. `npm install`
4. `npm start`
5. Point your browser to [http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server](http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server)
6. Profit!
